# AzureDataFactoryJsonInterpreter

A short program I wrote to read JSON files generated by Azure Data Factory and convert the 'script(Lines)' portion to something that can be worked with.

At this time it is very much a work in progress, but already somewhat useful. Currently the program outputs code to display an ADF dataflow as a [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) flowchart.

Next steps:
- User input.
- Execute for all JSON files in a specified folder.
- Generate useful documentation in Markdown format.
- Generate documentation (text and flowchart) that can be imported in a Azure DevOps wiki.
